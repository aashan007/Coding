1) How to check if a given number is a power of 2 ?
2) Count the number of ones in the binary representation of the given number.
3) Check if the ith bit is set in the binary form of the given number.
4) How to generate all the possible subsets of a set ?
5) Find the largest power of 2 (most significant bit in binary form), which is less than or equal to the given number N.

Applications of bit operations:

1) They are widely used in areas of graphics ,specially XOR(Exclusive OR) operations.
2) They are widely used in the embedded systems, in situations, where we need to set/clear/toggle just one single bit of a specific register without modifying the other contents. We can do OR/AND/XOR 
operations with the appropriate mask for the bit position.
3) Data structure like n-bit map can be used to allocate n-size resource pool to represent the current status.
4) Bits are used in networking, framing the packets of numerous bits which is sent to another system generally through any type of serial interface.
